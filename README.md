<p align="center" style="font-weight:bold"> ðŸ‘‹ <b>Hi there!</b> <p>

ðŸ’» I'm Luca Lumetti, a `Ph.D. student in ICT` at UniMoRe. My topic is about `Healthcare applications of Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Medical Imaging` and I'm currently working on the `segmentation of the Inferior Alveolar Canal through CBCT images`. A 3D segmentation of such canal is really important because it hosts the Inferior Alveolar Nerve, which must not be damaged during surgical operations.
Prior to my Ph.D., I've obtained an `MSc and BSc degree in Computer Engineering`, with a focus on the `Artificial Intelligence` field.
In the past, I've been an active contributor in the `web team` of `Ubuntu-IT`, a part-time professor in high school teaching IT subjects, and a freelance fullstack developer.
